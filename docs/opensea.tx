The PEBKAC series (pebkac.fyi) is dynamically generated SVG with daily location and solar wind telemetry data (1977 - 2005) from the Voyager 1 spacecraft. This one is meant to be seen in larger views and should be good for print. Each is a random view from a celestial body in our solar system. The signal strength of voyager degrades over the series and is highlighted when close to one of the bodies. Major solar storms and other worldly events are highlighted along the way. More project details and variation information can be found at https://pebkac.fyi. The telemetry has been sourced from public domain data in the NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive.
