# PEBKAC
The PEBKAC series (pebkac.fyi) is dynamically generated with location and solar wind telemetry data from the Voyager 1 spacecraft. Each is a random view from a celestial body in our solar system. The signal strength of voyager degrades over the series and is highlighted when close to one of the bodies. Major solar storms and other worldly events are highlighted along the way. More project details and variation information can be found at pebkac.fyi.

## Overview
In this series I wanted to continue to explore interesting data sets and incorporate their influence in to the dynamic generation. While many look simple, I think there are some fun things to find along the way in the whole series. Seeing one next to another and knowing the variations between as well as from the start to the end of voyager's journey make the collection meaningful to me.

The series progresses for each day from Voyager 1 launch (September 9, 1977) through the end of location telemetry data available in the data set (January 1, 2005). Included are two data sets for location telemetry and solar wind experiment metrics. More detail on these can be found below.

## Variations

| variation                      | description  |
|--------------------------------|--------------|
| celestial_body | One of the celestial bodies in the solar system |
| voyager_date | The series covers 9997 days from September 9, 1977 through January 1, 2005 |
| palette | 3 sets of color palettes |
| night_sky | Each celestial body will have a night sky with approximate other viewable celestial bodies randomly placed |
| solar_wind | The solar wind experiment data is on the top label (more detail below) |
| location | Voyager 1 location telemetry is on the bottom label (more detail below) |
| landscape | The colors are randomly pulled from the 3 sets of palettes (celestial body specific). The number of layers/bands and general locations of each are randomly picked |
| voyager_signal | Should flow across the landscape if the origin is below the horizon (hopefully) |
| signal_strength1 | The signal strength should be stronger if the space craft was in close proximity of the celestial body |
| signal_strength2 | The circles will start to part into dashes and further distance after voyager has "left the solar system" |
| signal_animation | Random signal animation |
| solar storms | The Voyager 1 signal will be noticably highlighted during some of the major solar storms of the period |
| memorials | The Challenger and Columbia dates are memorialized |
| women | Sally Rides achievement date is marked |
| annuals | Martin Luther King day, random signal pride color in June, Halloween |
